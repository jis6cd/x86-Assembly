# x86-Assembly

For this assignment, students were tasked with writing a program that implemented the Collatz Conjecture.

Note that for this assignment, only the threexplusone.s file is written in machine code.

Also note that some of the comments and methods were given to us from our professor, however the majority of the work was done by the student.
